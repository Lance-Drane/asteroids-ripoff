This was a project I created for a class using jQuery and Javascript. I started coding from the template found here:
https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/
...and modified it from there.

The original concept of the program was to have a story where you play as the Soup Nazi from the television show Seinfeld. You were trying to collect soup to gain points, while avoiding the floating heads of Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and George. I was unable to implement the required graphics on the canvas, and resorted to using a blue square for the Soup Nazi, green squares for the soup, and red squares for the enemies. I did keep the intended text from the "story", though.

TODO: Note that if you try to play in a browser with a smaller width than the width of the infoContainer div, the browser will make adjustments as your scores are modified.
